What is the procedure to are overdraft fees charged and how can I avoid them?
1. Standard overdraft fee: $29 per occurrence (max 3 per day).
2. Platinum and Diamond tiers receive one fee waiver per statement cycle automatically.
3. Enroll in Overdraft Protection to link a savings accountâ€”transfers are $5 instead of the standard fee.
4. Set up Balance Alerts to receive push notifications when your balance falls below a custom threshold.
5. If you need further assistance, contact ToggleSupport via chat 24/7.
